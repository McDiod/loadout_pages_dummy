# GRAD Loadout, an improved A3G Loadout

Declarative loadout system for Arma3 by [Gruppe Adler](https://www.gruppe-adler.de/).

## Acknowledgment

*As mentioned above, this is a continuation of mostly [Cephei](https://github.com/Cephel)'s work in [A3G Loadout](https://github.com/v-Arma/a3g-loadout).*
*However, that project seems so dead and I changed so much that I saw it fit to rename repo & project. –– Fusselwurm, 2016-08-16*
